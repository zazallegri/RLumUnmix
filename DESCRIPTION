Description: The R package 'RLumUnmix' is a collection of R functions intended to be 
            used for provenance analyses. It allows you to generate synthetic TL and OSL signals based on 
            the parameters of the physical model "Bailey2001", using the R packages Luminescence and RLumModel. 
            Different parameters enable to generate various signals corresponding to different sources, 
            that can then be "mixed" synthetically with the sandbox package. Finally, the extracted synthetic 
            sediment section can be unmixed using the fingerPro package (included in 'RLumUnmix') in order to 
            decompose the set of luminescence signals into provenance components (percentage of contribution 
            of each source). Additionally, this package can also be used to perform the same analyses but from 
            "real world" sediments, by reading data from BIN/BINX files.
